        <p class=center>Biko rejected the apartheid government's division of South Africa's 
        population into tribal and ethnic groups, instead dividing the population 
        into two categories: the white and the black.<br><br><b>Biko is viewed as the "father" 
        of the Black Consciousness Movement and the anti-apartheid movement's first icon.</b><br>
        <br><font color=red>On 11 September, police loaded him into the back of a Land Rover, naked and manacled,
        and drove him 740 miles (1,190 km) to the hospital.There, Biko died alone in a cell
        on 12 September 1977.</font></p>
