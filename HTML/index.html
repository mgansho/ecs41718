      <h2>Soccer:</h2>
      <p>In my current day life I play a lot of soccer. I have practices 2 days a week on Mondays and wendsdays for one hour each.<br>Then on 
      fridays I have a game and I sub for a diffrent team that needs me to help. I got into soccer through my coach back when I was Nine years
      old,he told me that I could try out for a travel team if I wanted to so I took the opportunity and haven't quit ever since.</p>
      <h2>Skiing:</h2>
      <p>I started skiing when I was 8 and to be completley honest when I first started I didnt enjoy it that much and I picked snowboarding for about two years.
      Snowboarding was actually a ton of fun and I really enjoyed it, but everyone in my famly skies so I picked it back up.As I countnued to progress in skiing 
      I got better and better. And today I am actually a pretty good skier.</p>
      <h2>Fishing</h2>
      <p>I have been fishing for as long as i can rember i stated in a little pond in the backyard of my aunts house and as we go on trips I always find time to fish.
      My favorite place to fish is qhwn my family goes to cape may and we visit my grandmother. Out there i catch stingray sharks and flounder it is a ton of fun and I
      thouroly enjoy spending time with my family. Another great trip my family goes on is trout fishing. I especially love this trip because we spend all day fishing
      catch a few and then eat the fish for lunch This is a trip I constantly look forward to</p>
